<v ->My name's Jose Salvatierra, founder of Teclado.</v>

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.770
We created the most popular

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.230 line:15% 
REST API development course on Udemy.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.330 line:15% 
We've over 4,000 reviews and 20,000 students.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.190
Now we've created this advanced REST API course

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.210
to take you even farther in your API and development

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.830
using Flask and Python.

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.740
Our first course took you from zero to a deployed REST API

10
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.430
that your users could access.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.100
But tonnes of students asked for more.

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.720
You guys wanted to send emails, deal with image upload,

13
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.120
deal with payments, database migrations,

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.950
and the list goes on.

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.297
After spending months creating and streamlining this course,

16
00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:45.973
I'm proud to say we've got your back.

17
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.870
This course will guide you through adding

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.800
all those features and more

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.150
using the latest technologies and the best practises.

20
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.860
We also teach everything in this course

21
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.530
using Python 3.7, the latest version.

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.010
Do note though, that this is an advanced course.

23
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.690
So while you don't need to take

24
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.170
our introductory REST API course,

25
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.190
programming experience with either Python

26
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.783
or another programming language is necessary.

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.550
In addition, if you have some knowledge of how the web works

28
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.380
that would also be really helpful.

29
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.520
More information on this

30
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.770
is available in the course description below.

31
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.080
So how is the course structured?

32
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
Well, students loved the format of our previous course

33
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.060
where we introduced new features

34
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.380
by baking them into an application.

35
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.270
We're going to do the same in this course

36
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.180
so that you can see how a professional

37
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.610
REST API is developed.

38
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.400
We start with a simple REST API

39
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.550
and teach you everything you need to know about it.

40
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.060
So even if you've not taken our introductory course,

41
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.100
you'll follow along with absolutely no issues.

42
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.500
We've also got a short ebook to help you with this.

43
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.440
Then, we'll migrate from reqparse to marshmallow

44
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.070
to simply our code and make it more readable

45
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.173
and more maintainable.

46
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.380
Through the following sections,

47
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.410
you'll work on features like user confirmation emails

48
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.650
so your users have to click a link in an email

49
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.620
before they can activate their account.

50
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.210
You'll deal with image uploads.

51
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.100
We'll add translations, database migrations.

52
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.390
We'll deal with payments and we'll even

53
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.243
use third-party services to log in with OAuth.

54
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.840
As we go through the course,

55
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.940
we'll help you understand

56
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.270
how to develop features incrementally

57
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.320
so you can get them to your users quickly

58
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.400
and minimise risk.

59
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.203
Many lectures contain extra resources

60
00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:32.400
for you to go out and learn more.

61
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.490
And for every lecture,

62
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.720
we've included the source code

63
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.340
at the start and at the end,

64
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.400
so you'll never be lost.

65
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.900 line:15% 
I really can't wait to guide you through this course.

66
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.870 line:15% 
You can' go wrong.

67
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.293 line:15% 
So join me and I'll see you on the inside.
